This serves as a Monty Hall Problem simulator. 
Here's an overview of the way it works:

Main.py
    Handles I/O (asks for the number of iterations, where an iteration is a single Monty Hall Problem).
    Calls generator.py to set up the temporary data files.
    Calls visualise.py to visualize the outcome of the iterations in real-time.
